# score-grader
score-grader console application
using HTML and JavaScript

this allows user to input their name and their score (which is graded over 100)
any score between 100 and 80 is an A
any score between 79 and 60 is a B
any score between 59 and 40 is a C
any score between 40 and 1 is an F
when a user doesn't input anything, the console will read "input your mark"
and also if the user inputs a number outside the range of 100 and 0, like 456, it will show in the console "input your mark"
